# 🏰 Asgard AI Platform — Business Plan

> Version 1.0 · March 2026

---

## 1. Executive Summary

**Asgard** is a self-hosted AI platform that gives organizations complete control over their AI stack — from LLM inference to RAG pipelines to autonomous agents — running on their own hardware with zero cloud dependency.

**What's built:** 23 sprints delivered across 5 components, 37 features, 255+ tests. Mimir (core platform) is production-ready with multi-tenant IAM, Agent Studio, Knowledge Graph, and Coverage Analytics.

**Market opportunity:** The AI platform market is $28B (2025) growing to $147B by 2030. Self-hosted solutions for regulated industries (healthcare, legal, finance) represent a $4.2B segment with 35% CAGR.

**Revenue model:** Open-core (AGPL-3.0 Community + Commercial Enterprise License). Enterprise pricing starts at $5,000/year per instance.

**Ask:** Bootstrapped initially. Seeking $500K seed round for Year 2 expansion.

## 2. Problem Statement

| Pain Point | Who Feels It | Current Solutions |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Data sovereignty** | Healthcare, legal, finance | Cloud AI = data sent externally |
| **Vendor lock-in** | All enterprises | OpenAI/Azure proprietary APIs |
| **Cost at scale** | High-volume users | $0.01/token adds up fast |
| **Compliance (HIPAA/PDPA)** | Regulated industries | Build from scratch or accept risk |
| **Integration complexity** | Engineering teams | Glue together 5-10 tools |

---

## 3. Solution

Asgard is a **complete, modular, self-hosted AI platform**:

| Component | What it Does | Unique Value |
|:--|:--|:--|
| 🛡️ Heimdall | LLM Gateway | MLX native on Apple Silicon, vLLM on NVIDIA |
| 🧠 Mimir | RAG + Agent Builder | Full pipeline: ingest → chunk → embed → retrieve → generate |
| ⚡ Bifrost | Agent Runtime | ReAct loop, MCP tools, A2A protocol |
| 🐺 Fenrir | Computer Use | Browser/shell automation for agents |
| 🌳 Yggdrasil | Auth | Centralized SSO (Yggdrasil) |

**Key differentiator:** Only platform that natively supports Apple Silicon (MLX) AND NVIDIA (vLLM) for local inference, with a complete RAG + Agent pipeline built in Rust for performance.

## 10. Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Dify/competitor catches up** | Medium | High | Move fast; MLX native is hard to replicate |
| **Apple Silicon niche too small** | Low | Medium | vLLM support covers NVIDIA; dual-platform |
| **Solo founder bottleneck** | High | High | Hire first engineer at $100K ARR |
| **Enterprise sales cycle too long** | Medium | Medium | Start with design partners (free); reduce friction |
| **AGPL compliance monitoring** | Low | Low | License key enforcement; AGPL copyleft protects |
| **Open source fork** | Low | Medium | Stay ahead; Enterprise features create value gap |
